## Hi there, I'm Sunny 👋 

## About Me

I'm love to read and experiment with building **scalable infrastructure**, **automating complex workflows**, and creating **reliable deployment pipelines** that bridge the gap between development and production. Applying this to the field of Machine Learning / AI is exciting for me since it bridges the gap between theoretical analysis and practical value.

Currently, I'm exploring **container orchestration**, **observability platforms**, and **infrastructure as code** to build more robust and maintainable systems.

My background:

- MEng Aerospace Engineering (Hons.) from Brunel University London
- 3.5+ years experience at HSBC as a Corporate/Investment Banker
- 7+ years working on and growing my Homelab (please feel free to take a look!)
