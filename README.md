## Hi there, I'm Sunny üëã 

## About Me

I'm love to read and experiment with building **scalable infrastructure**, **automating complex workflows**, and creating **reliable deployment pipelines** that bridge the gap between development and production. Applying this to the field of Machine Learning / AI is exciting for me since it bridges the gap between [finish sentence]

Currently, I'm exploring **container orchestration**, **observability platforms**, and **infrastructure as code** to build more robust and maintainable systems. This has been used with [insert one or two projects]

- MEng Aerospace Engineering (Hons.) from Brunel University London
- 3.5+ years experience at HSBC as a Corporate/Investment Banker
- 7+ years working on and growing my Homelab (please feel free to take a look!)

**Let's Connect!** I'm seeking opportunities in MLOps, DevOps, and infrastructure engineering.
